- Please apply the model first: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
- If you haven't been granted access to this model, you can use other LLM model that doesn't have to apply.
- You must save the hf token otherwise you need to regenrate the token everytime.
- When using Ollama, no login is required to access and utilize the llama model.

### Introduction to Ollama
- Ollama is a platform designed for running and managing large language models (LLMs) directly **on local devices**, providing a balance between performance, privacy, and control.
- There are also other tools support users to manage LLM on local devices and accelerate it like *vllm*, *Llamafile*, *GPT4ALL*...etc.
